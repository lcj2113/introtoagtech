					<h4>OSHA 30</h4>
						<p>As we work through the OSHA-30 module we review the importance of safety and health in the workplace.
						<br>OSHA stands for the Occupattional Safety and Health Act. OSHA's mission is to save lives, prevent illness and protect the health of workers.
						<br>
						Created in 1971, by 2007 cut workplace fatalities by 62% and injury/illness by 42%, administers federal safety and health laws to provide safe workplace
						<br>
						Anything in the workplace can be a hazard and it is up to a company, employers and employees to maintain the safety of each other and those in the workplace. For every 3,000 hazards that you encounter in your place of work, you will have 300 near miss experiences. Of those 300 near miss incidents, 30 of them will result in a worker getting injured.
						<br>
						Workers and employees have rights: have a safe workplace, know about hazardous chemicals, see info about injuries in the workplace, training, obtain records, complain without retaliation, and participate in inspections. Employers have the responsibility to enforce this by providing medical personnel, training and training materials, PPE, eliminating or substituting hazards,
