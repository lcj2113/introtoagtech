					<h4>Food Systems</h4>

						<p> During our first session in the Agriculture module, we started discussing Food Systems. Food systems both on a micro and macro scale are complex systems linked to the production and consumption of food. There are different cultures of consumption - depending on a subgroup, a geographical region, country, culture, etc. There is even the possibility to have multiple food systems within the same area. 
						<br>
						Chinatown is an example of a micro food system, within a larger system. Chinatown has their own food distribution system, cutting out the middle man and getting straight to the fresher source, less time on the road.
						<br>
						<br>
						Sustainable Food Systems are the goal: systems that can be sustained on their own indefinitely.
						<br>
						<strong>Environmental:</strong> recycle all nutrients, energy, water and materials that are put in, and avoid waste that affects our waterways, wildlife and land. <em>Biodiversity is important but hard to achieve in commercial farming.</em>
						<br>
						<strong>Economic:</strong> must be able to grow economically, be affordable to the consumer while keeping up with changes in the economy in the future.
						<br>
						<strong>Social:</strong> fostering community and growing foods that promote the enrichment and thriving of the communities that buy them - especially cultural foods. Food security is a must.
						<br>
						<br>
						We also reviewed <strong>Closed Loop Systems,</strong> which are ideal systems to continue natural processes in the world. There are no 100% closed loop systems, as some elements must be added periodically. Our current growth system in traditional agriculture is linear: we plant and harvest food; people consume it and create waste; waste is in landfills and ocean
						The goal is to reduce waste and become self-sufficient while addressing issues of sustainability.</p>
						<br>

						<h4>Mycology 101</h4>
					
							<p><strong>Terms to know:</strong>
							<strong>Mycology:</strong> the study of mushrooms and their classifications <br>
							<strong>Mushrooms:</strong> fruiting body of fungi that produces spores for reproduction<br>
							<strong>Fungus:</strong> an organism that acquires food by dissolving the molecules around them. They do not photosynthesize and are not plants. <br>
							<strong>Mycelium:</strong> Vegetative part of the fungus, made of fine, white, thread-like spread in substrate. <br>
							<strong>Substrate:</strong> material fungi grow on and derive nutrients from. Examples of this are wood chips, straw, manure, brewers waste, coffee grounds, etc. It’s a great use of food waste *sustainability!*
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Types of Mushrooms:</strong>
							Common types: Oyster, Button, Shiitake, and Enoki. These are easy to produce both indoors and outdoors, and can be a very profitable market.<br>
							Others: Hen of the woods, Lion’s mane, Trumpet, Chantrelle <br>
							Wild mushrooms: Morels and Truffles are very fancy and very coveted.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Cultivation: </strong><br>
							Outdoor Cultivation allows for a limited number of mushrooms to be grown as it requires a lot of space, presents specific climate conditions but is cheaper and requires less care. Can be susceptible to pests.
							<br>
							Indoor Cultivation allows for a more controlled environment and access to a greater variety all year long. Costs to setup and run production are higher, but pests are less likely.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Phases of Production</strong>
							All mushrooms requires specific conditions for them to thrive but the following is the common cycle.<br>
							1. Composting: create the nutrient rich substrate. Mycelium need nitrogen <br>
							2. Pasteurization: heat sterilization of the substrate <br>
							3. Spawning: starter culture is added to the substrate, containing mycelium. Precise temperature and moisture levels is key. <br>
							4. Casing: adding material onto the substrate to serve as water reservoir and provide a surface for fruiting. <br>
							5. Pinning: Pins are the starts of mushrooms. At this point CO2 concentration is lowered, fresh air is introduced to stimulate development <br>
							6. Cropping: harvest season! Can be weeks or months, days between harvests until all nutrients in substrate consumed. Requires extra care and control over temperature, humidity and CO2 levels for continuous production <br>
							</p>

						<h4>Crop Selection</h4>
						<p>When choosing crops there is a set of criteria you should think about:<br>
						1. Taste: must taste good and be desirable, people should want it - smell good, look good, etc.<tbody></tbody>
						2. Profit Potential: think about how much does it cost to grow this plant versus the profit it will bring in. Exotic or unusual plants and crops are great, but they can be too labor intensive or costly to care for - so they may be good for a limited time, but have staples present<br>
						3. Health: most foods grown in hydroponic systems are beneficial and healthy. This means that we should care for the treatment of the fish in the system, how we dispose of waste from the harvest, as well as the treatment food receives during harvest and distribution.<br>
						4. Location/Viability: some plants can’t grow in all environments, even hydroponically because. Balance how much it takes to keep it alive and what you get out of it.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Crops that Work Well in Hydroponics:</strong><br>
						This selection will generally grow fast, be tolerant to root saturation, annual, resilient, and not need special care.
						Examples are lettuce, leafy greens such as spinach and kale, cucumbers, tomatoes, herbs such as mint, basil, cilantro (not woody stemmed), berries<br>

							<h4>Hydroponics</h4>
							<p><strong>Biomimicry</strong> is a design philosophy where we draw inspiration from nature to create functionality. 
							<br>
							An example of biomimicry was the design of swimsuit fabric based on shark skin. The microscopic fiber allowed swimmers to swim extremely fast, too fast for the Olympics and was banned (as is everything else nowadays!)
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Hydroponics, </strong> is the growing of plants in a much more sustainable environment that uses no soil, little water and nutrients, and gives maximum control to the grower of the conditions these plants are grown in. Usually done indoors, it allows for plants to grow at a quicker rate.
							<br>
							The four critical components of the hydroponic system are: light, plant support/growing medium, water, and aeration.
							<br>
							<strong>Light:</strong> can be from natural or artificial sources, and in the correct spectrum depending on the plant cycle.
							<br>
							<strong>Plant Support:</strong> a growing medium that can be perlite, rockwool, clay pellets, peat plugs, etc. that serves as a sponge to retain both water and nutrients for the plants to grow
							<br>
							<strong>Water:</strong> is critical as it replaces the soil and contains nutrients plants needs to grow
							<br>
							<strong>Aeration:</strong> Plants needs oxygen to grow, and must be supplements as it gets dissolved in water plants are in.
							<br>
							<br>
							Other important components of growing in a hydroponic system includes: providing enough space for growing, automating systems to increase efficiency (regulating water temperature with chillers, ice, etc; water and air circulation with fans, pH adjustment). 
							<br>
							Providing nutrients is of utmost importance: plants require NPK - nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to grow, along with other nutrients that they can pick up from their environment. 
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Hydroponic Systems:</strong>
							<br>
							<strong>Kratky:</strong> simplest, can be made of recycled materials; plants suspended in the air, hanging over nutrient water.
							 <br>
							<strong>Deep Water Culture (DWC):</strong>Need a container with a lid, growing medium. Plants float in a raft or are suspended 
							<br>
							<strong>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT): </strong>System where you have. Reservoirs in the bottom (take full of water), Pump constantly pumping water to growing area at top. Water will fall down because of gravity into the tank, and reused. 
							<br>
							<strong>Flood & Drain (F&D):</strong> Similar - reservoir with pump, water is recovered. In F&D - pump is not running constantly. Growing area will flood periodically, sit in that nutrient rich water, then the water will drain back out of the system.
							<br>
							<strong>Aeroponics:</strong> Like Kratky - container/reservoir with lid, water that bottom, roots towards the water, plant in growing. Sprayer jets that are spraying roots with nutrients. Constant water movement in the form of mist or spray
							<br>
							<strong>Fogponics:</strong> Same as aeroponics, but you create a fog or small particles of water, floating in the air, rather than a spray. Good for growing crops quickly, little issues with plant diseases</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md">
							<h4>Aquaponic Systems:</h4>
							Similar to hydroponic systems, but creates an even more *closed loop system* as fish are incorporated to provide majority of nutrients needed by plants thru filtered waste. Fish in this system can sometimes be used for food production.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Aquaponics Cycle:</strong>
							1. Fish: fish can be grown for food. They swim, they eat, they produce waste<br>
							2. Waste: fish poop removed from their environment to continue living<br>
							3. Bacteria: used to process the waste into nutrients or food for plants (and filtered)<br>
							4. Plants: as they grow and feed on waste, they clean the water that is returned to the fish<br>
							<br>
							Few inputs needed: fish food, light, extra nutrients if necessary, O2 and CO2
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Parts of an Aquaponic System</strong><br>
							1. Fish Tank: where fish are kept, also the main water reservoir<br>
							2. Air Pump: critical for keeping both fish and plants alive, usually need an air pump or two and an O2 system.<br>
							3. Sediment tank or filter: removes excess waste from fish tank, such as small pebbles, rocks etc.<br>
							4. Biofilter: bacteria live here that cover fish poop into plant nutrients<br>
							5. Hydroponics System: filtered water is used for plants, and clean water returned to the fish. Types of system great for growing in an Aquaponic system: Media Bed (a form of F&D containing a later amount of growing medium and can act as a medium and filter at once); NFT, DWC, and F&D
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Fish</strong><br>
							Ideal fish for the system must tolerate small, crowded tanks, some tanks can hold up to 300 fish and they grow in their life cycle; not sensitive to changing temperatures whether high or low, not sensitive to dirty water, and should be able to reproduce and grow quickly under these conditions. Mixing fish is uncommon, but possible
							<br>
							<strong>Fish to try:</strong><br>
							1. Tilapia<br>
							2. Trout<br>
							3. Catfish<br>
							4. Bass<br>
							5. Shrimp/prawns<br>
							6. Crayfish/Crawfish<br>
							7. Goldfish/ Koi<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Nutrients and the Nitrogen Cycle</strong><br>
							Fish can be the more sensitive of the two organisms in this system. Their waste contains Ammonium of NH4+, which is harmful for both. It converts to Nitrites (NO2-), and then Nitrates (NO3-) which is used for plants.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Maintenance</strong><br>
							Ensuring pH levels are stable is key for bacteria nitrifying waste. 6.5-7 ideal<br>
							Oxygen must be monitored. 5ppm min.
							<br>
							Water temperature should be comfortable for both
							<br>
							If necessary add nutrients like potassium, iron or calcium, but the fish nutrients are pretty good for the plants.</p>

						<h4>Hydroponic & Aquaponic Maintenance</h4>
						<p>Maintenance of our systems are of utmost importance because it can really affect the taste of our foods and the overall health of our system including the fish and plants. <br>
						<br>
						In order to maintain a healthy system there are things we must do periodically to keep it in check
						<br>
						<strong>Routine Checks:</strong> 
						Think that anything can go wrong, and make a list of that. 
						Have a daily checklist you run through at the beginning, during and end of the day with critical things that can fail at any point.<br>
						<br>
						Good things to check for are leaks: is water where it should or shouldn’t be? Are lights on and working? Any smells? Check plants for any deficiencies whether it is visually or the pH levels.<br>
						Use your senses in the workplace: do things sound normal? Do crops taste well? Is the equipment and automation running properly? Are there clogs? 
						<br>
						<br>
						Cleaning the system also allows for intermittent maintenance that can check for the integrity of the system and the sturdiness of the materials used to build the system out.
						<br>
						<strong>Purging:</strong>remove and replace the nutrient solution and water in the system. It removes decaying material that can clog the system or cause imbalance (3-6 weeks)
						<br>
						<strong>Deep Cleaning:</strong> this is a serious clean as the name states and should be done carefully to not harm the plants or cause them stress. It helps to remove potential pathogens, break up biofilm, take the system apart (important to think about system design - can you reach all the pipes? Are they easy to clean and get in to? Easy to access address breaks in the pipes?) Should be done every 3-6 months
						 <br>
						<strong>Surface Cleaning:</strong> any surface that hands and plants and other items come in contact with. Should be done daily to ensure sanitation of the area, prevent build up of old materials like dead leaves, etc.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Good cleaning materials:</strong><br>
						<br>
						Equipment:<br>
						* Brushes<br>
						* Pipe cleaners<br>
						* Scouring pads<br>
						* Rags<br>
						* Pumps<br>
						* Sprayers<br>
						<br>
						Solutions:<br>
						* High proof alcohol<br>
						* Food grade Hydrogen Peroxide<br>
						* Bleach (minimal)<br>
						* Food safe cleaning solutions like Steramine<br>
						* Vinegar<br>

						<h4>Good Agriculture Practices (GAP)</h4>
						<p>GAP is a USDA, government run semi-volunteer program that ensures the quality of agricultural products will present minimal hazards to consumers. Once certified, food will carry a GAP stamp. It is designed to deal with pathogens, viruses, and contaminants that can be present in food.
						<br>
						Food Safety Programs are part of the GAP program requirements. It tracks farm operations including a farm map, packing and washing areas, certifications of anyone that is in contact with foods, uses pesticides or handles machinery; emergency contacts, a Food Safety and Traceability plan, and sanitation and cleaning schedules.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>A good record tracks:</strong> training logs, individual crop batch number, date planted and location, date and person who harvested and packed, yields and customer distribution, water testing, pest control times and dates.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>What gets tracked?</strong><br>
						Water: water sources must be tested and the amount of times is dependent on the source. Test for lead, chemicals, and other bacteria
						<br>Livestock: track their movements, keep them from contaminating water sources.
						<br>Harvest, Washing, Packing: this is the point of highest exposure. Keep all areas, materials, and body parts clean. Detail the cleaning process, frequency, and methods used.
						<br>Biosecurity: prevent contaminants from entering grow area - set up a shoe washing station, ensure outside clothes isn’t used on sit, seal the area to prevent pests from coming in.
						<br>Storage: should be cleaned, inventory managed to ensure nothing goes bad after time. Have a plan for pests and pathogens in this area.
						<br>Worker Health & Hygiene: Clean bathrooms, keep sick people at home, and give out breaks and leaves when necessary.
						<br>Pest Management: a common source of contaminants. Set up traps and baits that are food safe, and keep track. </p>

						<h4>Design Principles</h4>
						<p>When designing your farm/grow space as well as the systems you are putting in place it is absolutely necessary to build out a plan.
							<br>
							<br>
						Ask yourself: 
						<br>
						<strong>What are your goals?</strong>
						How much produce do you want to grow in a year?
						Who am I serving? What do they want?<br>
						<br>
						<em>"I want to make this farm as sustainable as possible." or "I want to provide healthy food for my community."</em>
						Be realistic and as detailed as possible.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Make a plan:</strong> think about everything that can go wrong, and plan ahead for it. You won’t get everything, but you can get most of it down.
						Things you should think about: what certifications do we need? Where are our packing, harvesting, and storing areas going? Are they safe and healthy? Where is the location of the farm?
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Implement!</strong> This might be the most time consuming, but don’t despair and don’t go it alone. A farm is a huge undertaking no matter how small the space may be. Get a good team of people that have the necessary skills and delegate. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Tips:</strong><br>
						Keeping it Simple: Complex systems that require air pumps, automation, sprayers, filters etc can be great, but they can fail at any time and that can hinder your grow. Keep the system simple, use reasonable and cheap solutions to your problems
						I.e. insulate an outdoor, exposed sump tank to prevent freezing.
						<br>
						<br>
						Redundancy can Prevent Fails:
						Be balanced in your equipment choices, have backup equipment in place that can be triggered in the case of a fail.
						<br>
						<br>
						Design with long term in mind: make sure you can access the crops, trays, pipes, sprayers and all equipment and material. It needs to be cleaned, manipulated, and monitored at all times, and ensures the safety of all in the workspace.

						<h4>Seeding, Transplanting, and Harvesting</h4>
						<p><strong>Terms to Know:</strong><br>
							<br>
							<strong>Planting:</strong> making seeds germinate and grow <br>
							* It’s necessary to have special areas and conditions to help the growth cycle. <br>
							* Humidity is important and should be above 90% <br>
							* Light can be needed or not, depends on the seed. Light can also be used to manipulate the size and shape of the seedling. Watch out for algae growth!<br>
							<strong>Air Circulation</strong> to prevent mold <br>
							* Some seeds need special treatment! Some need stratification - cold; some need scarification - coat breakdown<br>
							<strong>Transplanting:</strong> moving a plant from one place to another, usually when it has reached a certain size in order to prevent root binding and allow for growth<br>
							* Transplant after the first set of true leaves come in <br>
							* Too early can impact yields <br>
							* Prune the roots If necessary <br>
							* Cull or pick out the best seedlings <br>
							* This is easier in hydroponics: pick up the growing medium <br>
							<strong>Pruning:</strong> remove parts of plant to help it grow, for style, shape, or health. <br>
							* Cut location is important: CUT ABOVE THE NODE! <br>
							* Have sharp and clean tools (shears, scissors, knives, hooks,saws, power tools) <br>
							* Cloning is a form of pruning, and enables one to reproduce a plant’s entire DNA and is good when need multiples of a successful plant. <br>
							<strong>Harvesting:</strong> remove parts or all of plant for consumption <br>
							* Some plants require total or progressive harvest <br>
							* Total: crops that are harvested and then regrown entirely (lettuce) <br>
							* Progressive: like pruning, removing parts for consumption and enable continuous growth & production (herbs)</p>
